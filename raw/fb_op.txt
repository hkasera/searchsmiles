JVP opposes anti-Jewish, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab bigotry and oppression.  JVP seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem; security and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians; a just solution for Palestinian refugees based on principles established in international law; an end to violence against civilians; and peace and justice for all peoples of the Middle East.\n\nNOTE: We are not responsible for comments left by others on this page.\n\nOur Political Platform\n\nJewish Voice for Peace is a diverse and democratic community of activists inspired by Jewish tradition to work together for peace, social justice, and human rights. We support the aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians for security and self-determination.\n\nWe seek:\n\n* A U.S. foreign policy based on promoting peace, democracy, human rights, and respect for international law\n*An end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem\n* A resolution of the Palestinian refugee problem consistent with international law and equity\n* An end to all violence against civilians\n* Peace among the peoples of the Middle East \n\nWe are among the many American Jews who say to the U.S. and Israeli governments: \"Not in our names!\"\n\nJVP supports peace activists in Palestine and Israel, and works in broad coalition with other Jewish, Arab-American, faith-based, peace and social justice organizations.\n\n\nFOR A CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY\n\nJewish Voice for Peace calls for a U.S. foreign policy that promotes democracy and human rights.  The United States must stop supporting repressive policies in Israel and elsewhere. U.S. military aid to countries in the Middle East must be based on rigorous enforcement of the Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts, which mandate that military aid may be used for only defensive purposes within the recipient country's borders, and that aid may not be delivered to countries that abuse human rights.\n\nUnder these guidelines, U.S. military aid to Israel must be suspended until the occupation ends, since the occupation itself is in violation of these guidelines. Military aid allows Israel to avoid making serious efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as conflicts with its other neighbors.  It enables the occupation, contributes to the devastation of Palestinian society and fosters the increasing militarization of Israeli society.\n\nJVP also calls for suspension of military aid to other human rights abusers and occupiers in the Middle East. This aid helps prop up autocratic and repressive regimes, promotes violations of human rights and international law, obstructs democratic movements, prolongs the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and fosters militarism and violence at home and abroad.\n\n\nFOR PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI PEACE\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians have the right to security, sovereignty, and self-determination within political entities of their own choosing.\n\nIsrael must end its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, completely withdraw from these Occupied Territories and relinquish all its settlements, military outposts and by-pass roads.\n\nJerusalem has to be shared in a manner that reflects its spiritual, economic, and political importance to both Israelis and Palestinians, as well as to all Jews, Muslims and Christians.\n\nThe plight of Palestinian refugees needs to be resolved equitably and in a manner that promotes peace and is consistent with international law. Within the framework of an equitable agreement, the refugees should have a role in determining their future, whether pursuing return, resettlement, or financial compensation. Israel should recognize its share of responsibility for the ongoing refugee crisis and for its resolution.\n\nThe parties must equitably distribute water and other natural resources.\n\nDiplomatic negotiations between the two parties must be held unconditionally. Countries other than the U.S. should be involved in peace negotiations. An international peacekeeping force should be established to protect all civilians.\n\n\nFOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nAll people of the Middle East deserve the right to democratic participation and equality within their societies, regardless of religion, ethnicity, culture, national origin, language, race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or other status.\n\nIsrael must cease its use of military force against Palestinian civilians, including attacks involving American-supplied F-16s and Apache helicopters. Moreover, Israel must stop land seizures; destruction of homes, infrastructure, orchards and farms; arbitrary arrests and imprisonment; torture; assassinations; expulsions; curfews; travel restrictions; abuse at checkpoints; raids; collective punishment; and other violations of human rights.\n\nPalestinians must stop suicide bombings and other attacks on Israeli civilians.\n\nThe international community must support Palestinian efforts to promote democracy and human rights, while understanding that this aim cannot be fully achieved under occupation.\n\nRacism and bigotry cannot be tolerated, whether in the U.S. or abroad, whether against Arabs or against Jews.\n", "name": "Jewish Voice for Peace", "phone": "(510) 465-1777", "website": "https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/"}
