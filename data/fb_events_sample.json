It\u2019s an emotional time for anyone, especially for people who are moving back into a home after being homeless. On May 5th, you have the opportunity to make that transition easier- we\u2019re calling it \u201cMoving Day\u201d.\n\nWith the click of a mouse, you can make a donation on May 5th during #EastBayGives that will help pay for the expenses associated with moving: furniture, linens, kitchenware, utility bills, and even security deposits.\n\nThis year, our goal is to raise $10,000 and find 50 new donors willing to make a donation to help our participants move into a new home. Contributions start at $20 but have no maximum limit!\n\nA gift of $25 can give a family who was recently homeless kitchen utensils for their new home. A $250 gift can help a family purchase groceries for a month. A $1,000 donation can help someone with a security deposit!\n\nAnd, if all of you decide to give at once, there's a chance we can win up to $4,000 in prizes!\n\nThanks to matching grants for this annual day of giving, the nonprofit with the most different donors between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. will win an additional $4,000. \n\nWe need your help to achieve our goal! If you remember to donate to Abode Services when you get to work at 9 a.m. on May 5th, our participants could have $4,000 more dollars to help with their #movingday! \n\nIn the following weeks, we will be updating this page regularly with more information and inspiration leading up to May 5th.\n\nPlease share this event with friends and families, tell us who helped you during your last moving day, and plan to donate at 9 a.m. on May 5th!\n\nVisit our donation site at: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/abodemovingday!","name":"Abode Services East Bay Gives 2015","place":{"name":"Abode Services","location":{"city":"Fremont","country":"United States","latitude":37.53376,"longitude":-121.96229,"state":"CA","street":"40849 Fremont Blvd","zip":"94538"},"id":"191454139310"},"start_time":"2015-05-05T00:00:00-0700","id":"374168722788898"},{"description":"Please Join Abode Services for an evening of music, poetry, and spoken word during the inaugural \"Feed Your Soul\" performance night at Mission Coffee on Thursday, November 20th at 7 p.m.\n\nThis event is a part of National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, a national campaign to raise awareness about homelessness. \n\nWhile enjoying an evening of entertainment, you'll have the opportunity to learn more about what you can do to help move people from the street into homes.\n\nWe are grateful to be working with Mission Coffee and Brask House Concerts, which has worked to bring you four musical acts including Michael McNevin, an accomplished folk song performer.
